    "prompt": "A confident small business owner, mid-30s, stands in a modern yet approachable office space, surrounded by subtle evidence of their work—organized shelves, plants, and natural textures like wood and brick. The owner offers a gentle, assured smile, exuding calm capability. The composition is editorial lifestyle documentary style: medium-intimate framing at eye level, with soft, dimensional natural lighting from nearby windows. The workspace feels lived-in and functional, not pristine, with warm-to-neutral tones and indigo accents present in decor or attire. Generous negative space and layered depth hint at possibility and clarity. The mood is quietly optimistic, grounded, and human, capturing the empowering outcome of thriving in business.",
